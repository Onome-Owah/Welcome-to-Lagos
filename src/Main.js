            <h2>Welcome to Lagos State</h2>
            <p>
            Lagos State (Yoruba: Ìpínlẹ̀ Èkó) is a state in southwestern Nigeria. Of the 36 states, it is both the most populous and 
            smallest in area. Bounded to the south by the Bight of Benin and to the west by the international border with Benin Republic, 
            Lagos State borders Ogun State to the east and north making it the only Nigerian state to border only one other state. Named 
            for the city of Lagos—the most populous city in Africa—the state was formed from the Western Region and the former Federal 
            Capital Territory on 27 May 1967.

            Geographically, Lagos State is dominated by bodies of water with nearly a quarter of the state's area being lagoons, creeks, 
            and rivers. The largest of these bodies are the Lagos and Lekki lagoons in the state's interior with the Ogun and Osun 
            rivers flowing into them. Many other rivers and creeks flow throughout the state and serve as vital means of transportation 
            for people and goods. On land, non-urbanized areas are within the tropical Nigerian lowland forests ecoregion with natural 
            areas containing threatened populations of mona monkey, tree pangolin, and hooded vulture along with a transitory population 
            of African bush elephants. Offshore, the state is also biodiverse as there are large fish populations along 
            with African manatees and crocodiles.

                <h2>Lagos Population</h2>
                <p>
                Lagos is the most populous city in Lagos State, Nigeria as a whole, and the continent of Africa. The conurbation is one 
            of the most populous in the world. As of 2015, the population of Lagos city was approximately 16 million. Lagos 
            is a port which originated on islands separated by creeks, such as Lagos Island, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos 
            Lagoon while protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up 
            to 100 kilometres (62 miles) east and west of the mouth. The metropolitan area of Lagos includes Ikeja (which is the capital 
            of Lagos State) and Agege and Mushin.

                <p>
                Lekki Free Trade Zone (Lekki FTZ) is a free zone situated at the eastern part of Lekki, which covers a total area of about 
                155 square kilometres. The first phase of the zone has an area of 30 square kilometres, with about 27 square kilometres for 
                urban construction purposes, which would accommodate a total resident population of 120,000. According to the Master Plan, 
                the free zone will be developed into a new modern city within a city with integration of industries, commerce and business, 
                real estate development, warehousing and logistics, tourism, and entertainment.
